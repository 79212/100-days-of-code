  Today, I took a break from Node to work on a top secret arduino project that's 7 years in the making!

  Since it's top secret I don't have much to post. I'm taking notes else where. To the curious cats out there, don't worry: I will make my project public soon.

  A requirement of this project is a Twitter API key. It's been months and Twitter hasn't gotten back to me on the status of my API key application. Maybe I should contact twitter in some other ways?
