## Day 31, R3
### 8/19/19

- ## Node
  I'm making a vanilla Node.js app with CRUD and sessions.

  I left off working on the verification URL. That's where I'll continue. My code is getting cumbersome. I need to refactor it.

  ## Where I Left Off
  Not a lot of note taking today. 
  
  I did a lot of refactoring and drying my code today. 
  
  I got the verification URL working, sort of. The only thing is bcrypt isn't working as expected. For some reason it hashes the same token differently each time. I wonder if this has to do with the 'salt' which I didn't look into so much. I'll look more into bcrypt tomorrow.

- ## Thoughts and Feelings: 
  I took a longer break today. This helped me code longer in total. I normally code 2 hours. Today, I felt like I could keep going. So I did. It may have also helped that I took less log notes. Maybe notes are tiring.
