### 7/18/19

- ## Node
  Continuing with Greg's book, [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087).
  
  ### Where I left off:
  I finally got everything important working. Except for the tweet and email related buttons, all of the buttons work.

  I started rereading [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087).

  ## Multiple Apps
  What if I want to make multiple apps? Do I just use the same linode and MySQL but use another database? What if I want the settings to be different for each database, but if they have the same MySQL settings file, is it possible for them to have different settings??

  From reading the book, I think you might have different servers for different apps in production. In development, maybe you could keep them on the same server.

  ## Reread [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087)
  I finished rereading [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087) and read chapter 7 for the first time.

  ## Redoing The Tutorial
  I started to redo and reread (again) [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087).

- ## Thoughts and Feelings:
  Tim Ferris talked about doing multiple passes of reading a book as opposed to doing slower comprehension focus reading. I'm implementing multiple passes of reading this tutorial. It's helpful because the first time I read about a new concept, I have no context. The second time, I have a new context for the concept and I can understand more.
