## Day 51, R3
### 9/8/19

- ## Node
  I'm making a vanilla Node.js app with CRUD and sessions.

  ### Where I Left Off
  I watched more of the tutorial [Express.js Tutorial: Build RESTful APIs with Node and Express | Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48) and followed along. I left off at [41:22](https://youtu.be/pKd0Rpw7O48?t=2482)

  ## What is Middleware
  >Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.
  >
  >Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
  >
  >Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
  >
  >- Execute any code.
  >- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
  >- End the request-response cycle.
  >- Call the next middleware function in the stack.

  ## Relationships in MySQL
  I watched these two videos:

  [Controlling your Databases with Sequel Pro, Part 4: Exploring Table Relationships and SQL Queries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is_DuOGcSxk)
  
  [MySQL tutorial 18 - Foreign Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dov-_hgJGLM)

  ## Where I Left Off
  I finished the Express.js video anf followed along. I started to look into relationships in MySQL. I'm trying to figure out how to set up a relationship.
