## Day 41, R3
### 8/29/19

- ## Node
  I'm making a vanilla Node.js app with CRUD and sessions.
  
  ### Where I Left Off:
  Yesterday, I added a function that creates a session, one that gets a session, and I started to create a login endpoint. I did some refactoring too. I'll continue working on the login endpoint.

  ## Login
  I started to work more on logging in. I decided to take a break and explore express and react. My stomach hurts and I have a slight fever which is making it hard to concentrate.

  ## Express
  I watched [Node.js + Express - Tutorial - What is Express? And why should we use it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45dAt9Gz8rE).

  I watched some of [Express JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE)

  The teacher said, "It's a dev dependency because it's only for development", which made me realize I haven't been saving dev dependencies the right way.

  The teacher recommended **nodemon** which allows you to not have to reset the server every time you make a change.

  He showed how to save commands in the scripts section of `package.json`:

  He also recommended Postman. You can use Postman to test different request instead of using `node_fetch`

  I watched a little bit of [React JS Crash Course - 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A)
