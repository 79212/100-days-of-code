## Day 40, R3
### 8/28/19

- ## Node
  I'm making a vanilla Node.js app with CRUD and sessions.

  ### Where I Left Off
  I'm rewriting my helper functions for the database so they can be used more generally. 

  ## Inconsistent Database Methods
  I made a bunch of database methods but they're confusing to use. They're not consistent. Some return the actual results from the database. Some resolve or reject with a message that the code passed to the method. Some return an object generated by the method. 

  This makes using the methods confusing.

  Someone told me if you don't use a framework you end up making one. That's what's happening, and I'm making a bad one.

  But this is helping me think about how to better unify methods. If they're more similar, I don't have to go back and try to remember how to implement each one.

  Naming these functions also makes a difference, too.
  
  `database.existsIn(table, condition, resolveContent, content)` checks if a record that matches `condition` exists. But instead of returning true or false as the name implies, the method resolves or rejects the `content` argument depending on whether `resolveContent` was set to true or false. 
  
  That's pretty confusing. A better name would be `resolveOrRejectContentIfValueExistsInFieldOfTable`. Which is really long. But we probably just need to change `existsIn` to return true or false.

  ## Where I Left Off:
  I added a function that creates a session, one that gets a session, and I started to create a login endpoint. I did some refactoring too. I'll continue working on the login end point.
