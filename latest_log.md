# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - Dashiell Bark-Huss

## Day 119, R3
### 11/15/19
- ## Twitter Bot
  I looked through more example github projects and documentation, but no solution. 
  
  I might next see if someone more experienced can help me. I reached out to [@jaredhanson](https://twitter.com/jaredhanson) the maker of `passport` and `passport-twitter`. Maybe he can help. But I haven't heard back.

  I also asked [@JacobMGEvans](https://twitter.com/JacobMGEvans) for help. I think he's going to help me tomorrow.

  ## Apprenticeship
  I reached out to a CEO a week ago and asked if I could apprentice the company.
  
  I thought it was going to be onsite, but right now it's remote which isn't my ideal, but I'm giving it a chance. The CEO said he's going to get a space downtown so that will be great if it happens. 
   
  The apprenticeship is cool because it's a developer and entrepreneur apprenticeship. Well, that's what I asked to do, so that's what it is! 
   
  The CEO is pretty busy and I basically invented the apprenticeship. So I probably have to take it upon myself to make sure I get to do what I want. 
  
  Today, I got to talk to the CTO, and another dev involved. I already feel like I'm making a difference because I asked why the app was built in Ionic instead of React Native or Flutter. The CTO had been thinking about that himself, and upon my suggested said we should start over from scratch in Flutter. That will be a great learning experience for me, because I want to learn Flutter myself.

  Shlo brought up that if I'm doing all this work for the company I should make sure I get equity. Since I haven't done anything yet, I'm not going to worry about it now. But it's important to be comfortable bringing it up when I feel it would be appropriate if I do end up making a lot of contributions. The CEO said something about it at our first meeting, anyways.

  I need to make sure I get the entrepreneurship side too. That's the magic of an apprenticeship- I can control what I do and learn because nobody is paying me. But I have to take charge and ask the CEO how I can learn. I have to squeeze all the value out of this! So I must be more organized and vocal about getting that guidance from the CEO.
