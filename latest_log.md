  ### Where I Left Off
  I realize that service workers are complex, so I I'm going to watch this tutorial today: [Vanilla JavaScript: Service Workers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers)

  ## See All Service Workers
  **Chrome**: chrome://serviceworker-internals
  
  **FireFox**: about:debugging#workers

  ## Where I Left Off:
  I finished with this video, [Work with the registration](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers/work-with-the-registration), from [Vanilla JavaScript: Service Workers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers).

  Tomorrow, I'll continue here: [Update the service worker](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers/update-the-service-worker)
