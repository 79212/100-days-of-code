  ### Where I Left Off
  I'm starting an app, I left off trying to start the app with express.

  ## express()
  > Creates an Express application. The express() function is a top-level function exported by the express module.
  >
  >var express = require('express')
  >
  >var app = express()

  ## Require Dotenv
  I just spent a ton of time trying to debug my app. The problem was I didn't require `dotenv` so my variables were undefined.

  ## Where I Left Off
  I left off playing with [geolocation](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp) in the console because I want to use it in my app. I started working on the post method.
