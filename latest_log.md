## Day 22, R3
### 8/10/19

- ## Reviewing Front End  
  Today I took a break from node to review frontend and make a project. I started a new streak tracker.

  ## Classes
  I read about classes:
  [Javascript Classes â€” Under The Hood](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/javascript-classes-under-the-hood-6b26d2667677)

  ## Tracker
  I ended with this for today.

  I'll find some time to make it pretty.
  
  I also reviewed grid, and javascript dates.

- ## Thoughts and Feelings:
  Time went by really fast today. Probably because I was building something and reviewing old concepts instead of learning something new.
