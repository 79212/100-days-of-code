  ### Where I Left Off
  I finished with this video, [Work with the registration](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers/work-with-the-registration), from [Vanilla JavaScript: Service Workers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers).

  I'll continue here: [Update the service worker](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers/update-the-service-worker)

  ## Where I Left Off
  Not much to report today, just going through [Vanilla JavaScript: Service Workers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers) and following along. 

  I left off on this video: [Work with exact routes](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers/work-with-exact-routes). For my own reference, I'm working in my this folder: `Exercise Files/03_04/End`.
