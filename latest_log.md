  ### Where I Left Off
  I watched more of the tutorial until [Implement a network-first policy](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers/implement-a-network-first-policy). Then I played around with service workers a little on my own. 

  ## Cache Disappearing
  I'm playing around with service workers. For some reason when I go offline, the cache dissapears on reload. I'm not sure why.

  ## Where I left off
  I'm exploring service workers in depth in the browser but the behavior is so funny to me.
