  ### Where I Left Off
  I'm playing around trying to get background sync to work.

  ## Background Sync Video
  I finally got LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda) to work. I like some of the new features, like Q&A. I think that's awesome! They took the search bar away that used to search the transcript of the videos, so I'm hoping they bring that back. I watched this video from LI Learning:

  ## Params in Express
  >**req.query**: directly access the parsed query string parameters
  >
  >**req.params**: directly access the parsed route parameters from the path

  -*from [Get Query Strings and Parameters in Express.js](https://stackabuse.com/get-query-strings-and-parameters-in-express-js/)*

  ## Where I Left Off
  I played with background sync and I got it to work with a param and get request. I made a sample project. Tomorrow I'll try to get it to work with POST.
