  ### Where I Left Off
  I got the timeline to update after a socket event updates the local storage. I also made tooltips on my timeline that show the times of each reality check. It seems a little slow so I have to reexamine what I'm doing. I think I have some extra requests that I could get away with not using.

  ## Slow
  I'm not sure why the fetches are so slow sometimes.

  ## Timeline
  I worked more on my timeline.

  ## Where I Left Off
  I ended trying to get the rc's to store to local storage before the database updates, so that if we're offline we still get an updated timeline. I thought I did this already but I guess I didn't.
