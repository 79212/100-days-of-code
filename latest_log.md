## Where I Left Off
I'm need to read how to enable [VM acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration). This is the first step in setting up the [Android emulator](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-android-emulator)

## Flutter
  
I cloned my apprenticeship flutter app from bitbucket.

When I tried to run in on my iOS device I got this:

>Error connecting to the service protocol: HttpException: , uri =
http://127.0.0.1:1026/ajNyr0hqArE=/ws

I tried a lot of different suggestions I saw online. In the end it seemed **unplugging and plugging in** my phone worked.


## Where I Left Off
### Flutter
I set up my Android Studio and simulator. I let off in the codelab [Step 1: Create the starter Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab#step-1-create-the-starter-flutter-app)
### Twitter Bot
I started watching [15.8: Heroku Deployment - Twitter Bot Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwWPunpypNA) and following along. I need to download the heroku CLI.
