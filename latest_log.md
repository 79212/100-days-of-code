  ## Where I Left Off
  I still didn't get to play with Socket IO. 

  All the data is stored locally. Next I can either work on the UI of displaying the RC times, or I can work on the websockets side.

  ## git commit --dry-run
  Examples: 
  - `git fetch --dry-run`
  - `git commit --dry-run`
  - `git push --dry-run`

  `--dry-run`:
  Show what would be done, without making any changes.

  ## Sample Socket IO CLI Chat
  I made an app that is a CLI chat using Socket IO. I used these two LI Learning videos:
  - [Create A WebSocket With Socket IO](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/node-js-essential-training-web-servers-tests-and-deployment/create-a-websocket-with-socket-io?autoplay=true)
  - [Emit Socket.IO events](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/node-js-essential-training-web-servers-tests-and-deployment/emit-socket-io-events?autoplay=true)

  ## Where I Left Off
  I started working on getting Socket IO to send data to localStorage when the database is updated.
