  ## Where I Left Off
  Now if the user is not connected to the internet the app collects a timestamp and saves it to local storage. Next I'll handle how it will send the timestamp from local storage to the backend.

  ## Service Workers
  Services workers make your app work offline.

  >A service workerâ€™s primary function is to intercept http calls made by pages and returning cached files.

  ## Sample Service Worker App

  I made a sampler service workers app [here](https://github.com/DashBarkHuss/service_worker).

  ## Where I Left Off
  I learned about service workers so I could use them in my app. I still have to handle sending the local storage to my database.
