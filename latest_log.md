  ### Where I left off
  I'm trying to get the right timestamps to post but something looks off.

  ## Reality Checks & Background Sync Working
  I got background sync to log the timestamp and geolocation of each reality check, even if offline.

  ## Store More Accurate Coordinates
  Right now the coordinates are storing to the 6ths decimal place. I need to edit the datatype so they store a more precise number since the actual geolocation is more precise.

  ## Where I Left Off
  I started working on getting reality check info for the user from the database to the UI.
