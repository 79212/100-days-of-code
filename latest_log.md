  ## LinkedIn Tutorial
  I finished the linked in tutorial on service workers.

  [Vanilla Javascript: Service Workers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers/)

  I'm going to play around with service workers to practice what I learned.

  I practiced doing some caching with the service workers and intercepting the fetch request to respond with the cached images.
