  ### Where I Left Off
  Going through [Vanilla JavaScript: Service Workers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers) and following along. 

  I left off on this video: [Visualize Your Cache](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers/visualize-your-cache)

  ## Where I left off:
  I watched more of the tutorial until [Implement a network-first policy](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vanilla-javascript-service-workers/implement-a-network-first-policy). Then I played around with service workers a little on my own.
