  ### Where I Left Off
  I ended on Chapter 2 Level 7 of Service Workies.

  ## Service Workies Progress
  I finished chapter 2.

  ## Playing in the browser
  I played with what I learned in service workies but I was getting funny behavior. I finally realized why:

  ## Scope
  Scope is important for service workers. Your service worker can't be in a sub folder of the page you're trying to control. There's a work around for this if you must.

  ## Where I Left Off
  I played with service workers in the browser. Tomorrow, I'll play some more then I'll a continue with service workies.
