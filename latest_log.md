## Day 100, R2
### 7/19/19

- ## Second Round Complete
  I finished my second round of #100DaysOfCode. I'm well on my way to coding every day this year. 
  
  This last round I continued learning frontend and started to dive into backend. I'm going to continue to look into backend. My goal is to be able to make a fullstack app from scratch. I'm very close to this!

- ## Node
  Continuing with Greg's book, [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087).


  ### Where I left off:
  Yesterday, I started to redo the [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087) tutorial. I continued with that today.

  Not much to report on today!

- ## Thoughts and Feelings:
  I'm super sleep deprived. I still haven't caught up on sleep from my trip home and the shiva is interfering. When I'm sleep deprived learning is difficult. Even walking is difficult. Everything is more difficult.

  I have been setting an alarm for 8:30am. My alarm wakes me every day. I think it's unhealthy to wake up to an alarm. I like to wake up *before* my alarm, because that means by body got enough sleep and woke up naturally. My alarm should just be for insurance. My alarm is waking me up before my body is ready to wake up.
  
  I don't like sleeping too late so I'm using my alarm temporarily to reset my schedule. But I'm not getting to sleep early enough.

  I'm going to try to do a short sleep related challenge. Something like 7-days-of-in-bed-by-11 or something. I'm on day 12 of no caffeine (except for chocolate before 5pm).

  The hardest part about keeping a good sleep schedule is the social pressure to stay up with people. It feels almost rude to tell someone you have to leave their event early to go to sleep. 
  
  When you have a sleeping partner it's extra hard. You're forcing them to comply with your strict schedule. I feel guilty. It was hard to convince my spouse not to be on his computer in bed while I'm trying to go to sleep. I finally got him to agree because I **let him do it anyways** and he saw that after an hour and a half I still hadn't fallen asleep. So the next night he said he would go on his computer on the couch instead. 

  If I take on a 7-days-of-in-bed-by-11 challenge, it will help me confront all these little issues that are stopping me:
  - Feeling rude for leaving events early
  - Feeling weird going to sleep before my spouse is in bed
  - Feeling guilty for having a strict sleep schedule that inconveniences others
  - Trouble stopping a chill session with my spouse or sister (who we live with) to go to sleep
  - Learning to be more assertive
  - Learning to make sleep a priority
  - Learning to feel like I deserve to control my sleep schedule
  
  Shortening my sleep onset is another issue, but I think these social issues are actually the more pressing. The guilt may itself delay my sleep onset. If I can over come these issues, I can next address shortening my sleep onset.
