  I decided to focus on some language agnostic programing concepts for a while. 

  I looked at two questions about Big O notation on [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/):
  - [Q1](https://brilliant.org/practice/big-o-notation/?p=1)
  - [Q2](https://brilliant.org/practice/big-o-notation/?p=2)

  I understood the first question. The second was more confusing. I played with the recursive function in the debugger for a while. I didn't get the answer right.

  ## Khan Academy
  I realized I need to look into Big O notation more. So I'm going to start [Khan Academy's Algorythms course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms).

  ## Logarithms
  Logs are used in Big O notation. So I reviewd [logs on khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:logs#x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:log-intro)
