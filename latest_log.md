## Day 118, R3
### 11/14/19
- ## Yesterday
  I was running around today and almost forgot to write my log. I did a lot of coding working on my twitter bot yesterday night and today.

  ### I've been updating how it's going in this thread:

  [Posting on behalf of a user, node.js](https://twittercommunity.com/t/posting-on-behalf-of-a-user-node-js/131767/4)

  It's Gary Vee's b-day. He's so great so I must dedicate two sentences to him in my blog today.
