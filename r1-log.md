# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Dashiell Bark-Huss

Dashie here, looking to start this challenge with the new year, Jan 1, Tuesday, 2019. Today is December 25th. I'm at a Starbucks in Tequesta, FL. I'm originally from Chicago, but I'm a nomad living in a Rialta, a van sized RV, with my spouse Shlomo. I decided to learn to code when our van broke down at a Barnes and Nobles in early 2017 and I bought a programming book. Now I'm looking to get more serious with my time so I'm commiting to this challenge. I already aim to spend 100 minutes a day doing coding tutorials, but I've decided to commit to an hour a day of hands on coding with this challenge. I'm not sure if my van's solar power set up will be able to handle the power required for these commitments, but I'm going to attempt the challenge anyways. I may still aim to just do 100 minutes a day, but use 60 minutes of that just for hands on coding and 40 minutes for tutorials. Ok, be back on Jan 1st!
## Pre-Round-Log
### PR1D1 - 12/26/18
I decided to do some preliminary days before the New Year starts. This way I can test power supply issues and other issues that come about from van lifing. Today, I coded for 63 minutes and 35 seconds. At the hour mark I was down to 68% power from 95%. I am looking into web dev environments I can use on my iPhone to save power.

Today I coded a very simple program. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I wanted to stay away from jQuery, which I'm learning, because I want to make sure I have some experience with just Javascript so I'll be able to tell the two apart better in the future.

My program counts the number of times you click a button. My goal was to code this from scratch- no copy and pasting snipets of code. I started with a blank page and did the whole HTML/code by hand. I deleted it and started from a blank page a few times in a row until I could do it without any typos and errors.

Ok now I need to figure out how to push it to github and link it here. Power currently at 63%.

OK here it is! Not sure If I should have done it as a gist or repository. I still don't know how this all works.
