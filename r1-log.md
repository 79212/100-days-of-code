# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Dashiell Bark-Huss

Dashie here, looking to start this challenge with the new year, Jan 1, Tuesday, 2019. Today is December 25th. I'm at a Starbucks in Tequesta, FL. I'm originally from Chicago, but I'm a nomad living in a Rialta, a van sized RV, with my spouse Shlomo. I decided to learn to code when our van broke down at a Barnes and Nobles in early 2017 and I bought a programming book. Now I'm looking to get more serious with my time so I'm commiting to this challenge. I already aim to spend 100 minutes a day doing coding tutorials, but I've decided to commit to an hour a day of hands on coding with this challenge. I'm not sure if my van's solar power set up will be able to handle the power required for these commitments, but I'm going to attempt the challenge anyways. I may still aim to just do 100 minutes a day, but use 60 minutes of that just for hands on coding and 40 minutes for tutorials. Ok, be back on Jan 1st!
