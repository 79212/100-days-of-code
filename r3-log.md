# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - Dashiell Bark-Huss


## Day 1, R3
### 7/20/19

## Round 3
Today is the start of round 3. This round I want to make some full stack apps, learn React, and play with unit testing. I want to get into AI and React Native if I have time.

The last two rounds I studied for 2 hours a day. I will continue that for now. 

So far, I've dedicated at least 400 hours this year to coding.

- ## Node
  Continuing with Greg's book, [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087).


  ### Where I left off:
  Continuing to redo the [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087) tutorial.

  ## Currying
  I saw this weird "chained function":

  ```javascript
  // line 355, api.js
  const resp = response => content => respond(response, content);
  ```
  I found out it's called ***currying***:
  >Named after Haskell Brooks Curry, currying is breaking down a function into a series of functions that each a single argument.

  ## Redid Tutorial Through Chapter 6
  I redid the tutorial through chapter 6. I'm trying to run `node index.js` but I ended with:
  ```bash
  Error: Cannot find module 'mysql'
  ```
  I need to add the mysql module.

- ## Thoughts and Feelings:
  To do:
  - Set up a second monitor.
  - Take my mac in to be checked out.
    - Why is the fan always on
    - What is making my storage go down so quickly
  - Get note cards from van.
