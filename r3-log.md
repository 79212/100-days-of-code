# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - Dashiell Bark-Huss


## Day 2, R3
### 7/21/19

- ## Node
  Continuing with Greg's book, [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087).


  ### Where I left off:
  Continuing to redo the [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087) tutorial.

  ## Super User Tips

  [Hotkey for switching between tabs / window panes on a Mac](https://superuser.com/questions/609821/hotkey-for-switching-between-tabs-window-panes-on-a-mac):
  - **Command + Tab** = switch between applications
  - **Command + ~** = switch between windows of an application
  - **CTRL + Tab** = move forward through tabs (in same window)
  - **CTRL + Shift + Tab** = move backward through tabs (in same window)

  ### Mission Control

    [How to Switch Between Open Apps in macOS](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/switch-between-open-apps-macos):
  - **Swipe up on the touchpad with three fingers** = mission control


  [Use Mission Control on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204100):

  - **Swipe left or right with three or four fingers on your Multi-Touch trackpad** = switch to another desktop space

  ## Dotenv
  I set up dotenv following this tutorial: [Setup environment variables with Node.js + Dotenv Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDup0I2VGmk_)

  Now I can push to github and not worry about my sensitive info.
  ```javascript
  // line 9, api.js
  this.connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: process.env.HOST,
    user: process.env.DBUSER, //Don't use `USER` because it's already an environment variable
    password: process.env.PASSWORD,
    database: process.env.DATABASE
  })
  ```

  ## Posted To Git Hub
  I added dotenv to my project and posted what I did with the tutorial this second time to github. It's just like the finished files except I only have one api endpoint, `action_register_user`.

  ## Redo Tutorial Take 3
  I'm going to try to redo the tutorial again. This time, without reading the book. I'm only going to use the book as a reference when needed. I'm also going to use my other finished files as reference. This time I want to make multiple endpoints.

  I made a new database and created a server. I started to get the server to redirect `/` requests to `index.html`.




## Day 1, R3

## Round 3
Today is the start of round 3. This round I want to make some full stack apps, learn React, and play with unit testing. I want to get into AI and React Native if I have time.

The last two rounds I studied for 2 hours a day. I will continue that for now. 

So far, I've dedicated at least 400 hours this year to coding.

  ## Currying
  I saw this weird "chained function":

  ```javascript
  // line 355, api.js
  const resp = response => content => respond(response, content);
  ```
  I found out it's called ***currying***:
  >Named after Haskell Brooks Curry, currying is breaking down a function into a series of functions that each a single argument.

  ## Redid Tutorial Through Chapter 6
  I redid the tutorial through chapter 6. I'm trying to run `node index.js` but I ended with:
  ```bash
  Error: Cannot find module 'mysql'
  ```
  I need to add the mysql module.

- ## Thoughts and Feelings:
  To do:
  - Set up a second monitor.
  - Take my mac in to be checked out.
    - Why is the fan always on
    - What is making my storage go down so quickly
  - Get note cards from van.
