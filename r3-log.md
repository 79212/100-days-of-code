# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - Dashiell Bark-Huss

## Day 6, R3
### 7/25/19

- ## Node
  Continuing with Greg's book, [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087).


  ### Where I left off:
  Yesterday, I got the API to connect to the database and grab information statically: the API always queried the same query.

  Today, I'm going to try to make the call dynamic, using the payload. I'm also going to try to send the info back to the frontend through the promise returned in the fetch call.

  ## Dynamic Query and Return Query Info
  I got the api to query the database dynamically, based on the payload. 

  The query sends the data back to the front end console.

  ## Next:
  Let's put the data in the UI.

  ## Query Info Returned To UI
  Now the query info goes to the UI.

  ## Next
  Let's add another API Query and move some of our code into helper functions so it's DRY. 

  ## Added Helper Functions, New Endpoint
  I refactored the code into helper functions so it's DRY. I added a new endpoint but I need to add the body to the endpoint tomorrow.

## Day 5, R3
### 7/24/19

- ## Node
  Continuing with Greg's book, [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087).


  ### Where I left off:
  I'm on my 3rd round of doing the tutorial. I'm not using the book, except as a reference when needed. I'm using my finished files as references.

  Yesterday, I made an API class. I left off with a bug when I call fetch from the UI:

  ```bash
  SyntaxError: Unexpected token b in JSON at position 1
  ```

  But I'm not getting that error when I call the same code from the backend.

  ## Refreshing
  I'm not getting that error now, so I think it was just a refreshing problem.

  ## Returning Promise To UI
  I got my UI to request an endpoint. The end point returns data to the UI. I'm not really sure where in the code the data is getting returned to the UI. Maybe it's when I call `response.end(content, 'utf-8')`?Maybe that sends the content to the fetch call??

  ### Link To Work: [promise returned to UI no helper functions](https://github.com/DashBarkHuss/node_server_multiple_endpoints/tree/589d27985e62690916835a02eb13da7537cb6984)

  ## What Next
  I think I should try to get the api to change the database now.

  ## MySQL
  I added a query to the database. Our endpoint grabs all the butt's of the owners who have flat butts.

  Well really it grabs all the *owners*, but I wanted to say it *grabs all the butts* for the pun.
  
  ```javascript
  // line 24, api.js
  let q = "select owner from butts where shape = 'flat'"
  database.connection.query(q, (error, results)=>{
    if (error)
      throw error;
    console.log(results);
  })
  ```


  <img src ="log_imgs/owners_7-24.PNG" width="500"/>

  <img src ="log_imgs/query_7-24.PNG" width="500"/>

  We've successfully grabbed 2d-Man's and Flatty Mcflat's *flat* butts. We didn't grab my *round* butt or my moms *square* butt. Those aren't *flat*.

  ### Link To Work: [flat butt query](https://github.com/DashBarkHuss/node_server_multiple_endpoints/tree/f2bb95b67b86713d7c05c17c990b5f3d37d21dd8)

  ## Tomorrow
  Tomorrow, I'll work on using the payload to change the query and returning information from the query back to the UI.

## Day 4, R3
### 7/23/19

- ## Node
  Continuing with Greg's book, [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087).


  ### Where I left off:
  I'm on my 3rd round of doing the tutorial. I'm not using the book, except as a reference when needed. I'm using my finished files as references.

  I need to make an API class and tell the `requestListener` in `httpCreateServer` what to do when it gets an API url.

  ## `.constructor`
  I thought this was an interesting conditional:
  ```javascript
  if (request.constructor === String)
  ```
  
  ## Testing API Calls With `node-fetch`
  `fetch` doesn't work in node because it's a WEB API. Node is on the backend so it doesn't have access to the Web API's. 

  I wanted to automatically fetch an API endpoint while testing it every time I restart the server. So I figured I needed to fetch the api from the node file on the backend, index.js. 

  To do this I installed `node-fetch`:
  ```bash
  npm install node-fetch --save
  ```

  I required `node-fetch` in index.js:
  ```javascript
  const fetch = require('node-fetch');
  ```

  I called `fetch()`. You much use an absolute URL for `node-fetch`:
  ```javascript
  fetch('http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/butt', {
    method: 'post',
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({butt: 'round'})
  })
  ``` 

  ## What Next
  I made an API class. I'm working on getting it to one endpoint. I left off with a bug when I call fetch from the UI:

  ```bash
  SyntaxError: Unexpected token b in JSON at position 1
  ```

  But I'm not getting that error when I call the same code from the backend.


## Day 3, R3
### 7/22/19

- ## Node
  Continuing with Greg's book, [Node.js – Server Setup](https://www.patreon.com/posts/node-api-source-27588087).


  ### Where I left off:
  Yesterday I started to redo the tutorial again. This time, without reading the book. I'm only using the book as a reference when needed. I'm using my finished files as references. This time I want to make multiple endpoints.

  I made a new database and created a server. I started to get the server to redirect `/` requests to `index.html`.

  ## Serves Html Files

  I made a server that serves html files. I used dotenv again to upload the directory without publishing my database server info. I'll use the database server info later to connect to the database.
  

  Link to work: **[node_server_multiple_endpoints, commit: serves html files](https://github.com/DashBarkHuss/node_server_multiple_endpoints/tree/ce8b0cdda6994d70852d053148c7f22a9e02be08)**
  ```javascript
  // index.js
  let http = require('http');
  let fs = require('fs');

  const ip = '127.0.0.1';
  const port = 3000;

  http.createServer(function(request,response){
    console.log(request.url);
    let file;
    if (request.url === '/') file = 'index.html'
    else file = request.url.slice(1, request.url.length);
    fs.readFile(file, function(error, content){
      if(error){
        if (error.code='ENOENT'){
          fs.readFile('/404.html', function(error, content){
            response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
            response.end(content, 'utf-8')
          });
        } else {
          response.writeHead(500);
          response.end('Error: ' + error.code + '\n');
        }
      } else {
        response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'})
        response.end(content, 'utf-8');
      };
    });

  }).listen(port, ip);
  ```
  I didn't yet add the mime type code. So if you put a png image in the directory and try requesting that image file, the server will interpret the image as html. You'll see a bunch of weird text. Changing this is not complicated but I'm going to skip it for now because I'm less interested in that.

  Next, should I try to connect to the database or make the API class? 
  
  I'm going to connect to the database.

  ## `--save-dev`
  >--save-dev: Package will appear in your devDependencies.

  -*[Difference between — save-dev and — save while running npm](https://medium.com/@arnab.k/difference-between-save-dev-and-save-while-running-npm-50e3c0784153)*
  
  I added the mysql npm package and the md5 package so I could require them. I used `--save-dev` so that they'll be included when others download my repo.

  ## No Semicolon In `.env` File

  I had semicolons in my `.env` file. That made the semicolons part of the variables:

  ```
  SOMEVAR = 'somevalue'; // the value will be "'somevalue';" with the semicolon included.
  ```

  It should be *without* semicolons, but it seems that you can *include **or** leave out* the quotes.

  ## Database Connects
  I added an `api.js` file and made the `database.create()` function in there. I required `api.js` in `index.js` and called the `database.create()`  function. 
  
  Since I'm using dotenv, when I run the module I use `node bin/dev`. `bin/dev` requires `dotenv/config` and `index.js` modules. Running `node index.js` won't work because `index.js` doesn't require the `dotenv/config` module, so `index.js` can't access the environment variables on its own. 

  Link to work: **[node_server_multiple_endpoints, commit: database connects](https://github.com/DashBarkHuss/node_server_multiple_endpoints/tree/06c8700932099e1c334c298654c89c1b12b7f476)**

  ```javascript
  // api.js
  const mysql = require('mysql');
  const md5 = require('md5');

  class database {
    constructor() {}
    static create(){
      let message = "Creating mysql connection...";
      this.connection = mysql.createConnection({
        host: process.env.HOST,
        user: process.env.DBUSER,
        password: process.env.PASSWORD,
        database: process.env.DATABASE
      })
      this.connection.connect();
      console.log(message + 'ok');
    }
  }

  module.exports = {database};
  ```

  ## What Next?

  Next, I need to start adding the API code. I need to make an API class. I'll need to tell the `requestListener` in `httpCreateServer` what to do when it gets an API url. Normally it would follow the file path requested. The API url may look like a file path, but it's not.

  Example:
  ```
  /api/user/create
  ```

  There is no api folder, user folder, or create file. Instead, we'll use conditionals to let the server know how to handle a request that starts with '/api'.

  I'm not sure if **'API URL'**, is the correct term. It may just be called an **'API endpoint'**.

  ## Super User Tips

  [Hotkey for switching between tabs / window panes on a Mac](https://superuser.com/questions/609821/hotkey-for-switching-between-tabs-window-panes-on-a-mac):
  - **Command + Tab** = switch between applications
  - **Command + ~** = switch between windows of an application
  - **CTRL + Tab** = move forward through tabs (in same window)
  - **CTRL + Shift + Tab** = move backward through tabs (in same window)

  ## Dotenv
  I set up dotenv following this tutorial: [Setup environment variables with Node.js + Dotenv Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDup0I2VGmk_)

  Now I can push to github and not worry about my sensitive info.
  ```javascript
  // line 9, api.js
  this.connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: process.env.HOST,
    user: process.env.DBUSER, //Don't use `USER` because it's already an environment variable
    password: process.env.PASSWORD,
    database: process.env.DATABASE
  })
  ```

  ## Posted To Git Hub
  I added dotenv to my project and posted what I did with the tutorial this second time to github. It's just like the finished files except I only have one api endpoint, `action_register_user`.

  ## Redo Tutorial Take 3
  I'm going to try to redo the tutorial again. This time, without reading the book. I'm only going to use the book as a reference when needed. I'm also going to use my other finished files as reference. This time I want to make multiple endpoints.

  I made a new database and created a server. I started to get the server to redirect `/` requests to `index.html`.




## Day 1, R3
### 7/20/19

## Round 3
Today is the start of round 3. This round I want to make some full stack apps, learn React, and play with unit testing. I want to get into AI and React Native if I have time.

The last two rounds I studied for 2 hours a day. I will continue that for now. 

So far, I've dedicated at least 400 hours this year to coding.

  ## Currying
  I saw this weird "chained function":

  ```javascript
  // line 355, api.js
  const resp = response => content => respond(response, content);
  ```
  I found out it's called ***currying***:
  >Named after Haskell Brooks Curry, currying is breaking down a function into a series of functions that each a single argument.
  
  -*[Currying in JS](https://hackernoon.com/currying-in-js-d9ddc64f162e)*

  ## Redid Tutorial Through Chapter 6
  I redid the tutorial through chapter 6. I'm trying to run `node index.js` but I ended with:
  ```bash
  Error: Cannot find module 'mysql'
  ```
  I need to add the mysql module.

- ## Thoughts and Feelings:
  To do:
  - Set up a second monitor.
  - Take my mac in to be checked out.
    - Why is the fan always on
    - What is making my storage go down so quickly
  - Get note cards from van.
